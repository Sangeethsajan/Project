    <h1 class="mt-5 display-1">The Happiness Report :)</h1>
    <h2 class="display-6">Where happiness is mere digits</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

        I would like to do a Visualization of the World happiness Report in which I would like to answer some research questions like, Does the happiness score and GDP Per capita have any relation? Does the Continent and happened score have any relation? Does the life expectancy could provide anything positive to the happiness score?
    </p>
    <div id="my_dataviz2"></div>
  <p class="lead">Variables in the data: GDP per Capita, Family, Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, Trust (Government Corruption), Country, Region, Happiness Rank, Happiness Score, Economy.</p>
  <p class="lead">From the graphs represented. The first one is a choropleth map which shows the happiness data of the whole world. From the data shown we can easily conclude few things. Most developed countries and European Nordic countries are having a greater happiness level when compared to other places
Some Sub Saharan countries ,Some African countries and few Asian countries are hvaing poor level of happiness scores. So a clear distinction between the developed countries and thrid world countries are visible from the graph. The Second graph represents the the comparison of GDP Per Capita, The life expectancy and the Happiness Score of the
top 5 and bottom 5 countries. Here every variable is converted to a standardized number format. From the graph we can clearly say that the GDP Per capita is a factor which is affecting the happiness index of a country. Life expectancy is also having the same effect. Life expectancy is a clear indication of the hospital fecilities, Health infrastrucre, Nutricious food availability,
Infant mortality rate and much more. All these factors directly or indirectly afftect the happiness level of a person. So from this we can easily conclude that happinedd index scores are greatly affected by the GDP Per Capita and the Life expectancy of a nation.

  <p class="lead">I gathered the data from the Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness">website</a>.
    It has been over ten years since the first World Happiness Report was published. And it is exactly ten years since the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 66/281, proclaiming 20 March to be observed annually as International Day of Happiness. Since then, more and more people have come to believe that our success as countries should be judged by the happiness of our people. There is also a growing consensus about how happiness should be measured. This consensus means that national happiness can now become an operational objective for governments.
